e) documentation in subdirectory doc

   README                         this text
   multi_manual.pdf               quick start manual
   mul23.pdf                      list of changes from version 1.0 to 2.3
   mul23_exercises.pdf            a number of exercises
   idldoc.pdf                     help text for some IDL procedures

f) IDL routines in subdirectory idl

   see multi_manual.pdf for a list

Executables are called mul23abc.x where 
   a  denotes operator type (g or l)
   b  denotes opacity package (u)
   c  denotes scratch file storage (s)
We thus get the two combinations:
   mul23gus.x mul23lus.x

The Oslo opacity package is no longer supported.


2. Unpacking of distribution

   a) set working directory to wanted root directory. 
   b) unpack tar file, directory mul23 and subdirectories
      doc, input, run source, source_dp are created
   c) set working directory to source
   d) run script make_mul23_dbl.csh

Single precision executables are made in diretory source, double
precisions executables in directory source_dp. Note that only
variables in include files and in the file mul23_opacu.f are allowed
to have a variable type not conforming to FORTRAN implicit typing
(variables beginning with letter I-N are type integer, other variables
are real or real(8)). New routines and changes to old ones should
conform to this convention.


3. Sample run

To make sample run:

   set working directory to source_dp  (double precision version recommended)
   make mul23gus.x                   make executable
   cd ../run                         set working directory to run
   ln -s ../source_dp/mul23gus.x .   symbolic link of executable to run (final . needed)
                                     directory
   ./run.csh ca6 val3c 23gus         run

output can be compared with file input/out.ca6_val3c. Small differences will
exist due to different floating point formats but EMAX values (grep
EMAX out.ca6_val3c and grep EMAX ../input/out.ca6_val3c) should give values that are
identical to a few decimal places.

4. Machine dependencies

Compile, link and compiler option commands differ from machine to
machine.  These should be set through setting environment variables
in the shell-script startup file in your home directory. For cshell 
and derivatives the file is .cshrc and the following lines are
appropriate for the ifort compiler:
setenv FC ifort
setenv LINK ifort
setenv FOPT "-fast -fpe0"

for bash-shell the following lines should be added to .bashrc:
export FC=ifort
export LINK=ifort
export FOPT="-fast -fpe0"

The large array W is passed as an argument. This may cause overflow of
the stack on some machines. Compiling with a switch to store all local
variables statically solves this problem.

The routine ETIME can be used on many architectures to get timing
information. Since this function does not exist on many other architectures,
the call has been commented out from the function SECOND in mul23_sub.f.
Uncomment the lines to obtain timing on machines where ETIME exist or
replace the call with another CPU-time routine if timings are wanted.
As the code is now, the timing returns zero to the TIME file.


5. Recommendations for code conventions:

Try to restrict changes to as few routines as possible.

Do not change existing common blocks - rather add new ones specific
to the new version.

Stick to the implicit typing convention of FORTRAN. This makes it 
much easier to have both a single precision and a double precision
version of the code.

Do not change existing code if that is not absolutely necessary. It is
quite tempting to clean up the existing code by changing indentations,
statement labels, variable names etc. The increased clarity that may
result is not worth the incompatability with other versions around.
By restricting changes to a minimum it is much easier to incorporate
new features from other sources into any existing version.  Try not to
change the format of existing input files. It is really frustrating
to administer tons of input files if they have different formats. If
new information is needed - introduce new input files instead.
